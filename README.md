# RANSAC-image_stitching

RANSAC:   The goal is to fit a line to a given set of points using RANSAC algorithm, and output the names of inlier points and outlier points for the line. Specifically, there are in total N points, and we need to find a line to best fit these points. After finding this line, we can use the distance threshold t to determine which points are inliers and which points are outliers. That is, a point is inlier if the perpendicular distance of this point to the fit line is smaller than the threshold t; otherwise, it belongs to outliers. It is recommended to record the two initial points for each iteration, such that we will not start from this two points in next iteration.

Image-stitching:  The goal is to stitch two images together to construct a panoramic image. First step is to find keypoints (points of interest) in the given images using corner detector, e.g., Harris detector. Then, we use SIFT feature descriptor to extract features for these keypoints. Next, we should match the keypoints between two images by comparing their feature distance. After having the matched point pairs, we are able to compute the homography matrix using RANSAC algorithm. Finally, we can use the homography matrix to stitch the two given images.
